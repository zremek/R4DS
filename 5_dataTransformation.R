# 5.1.3 dplyr basics

### FIVE KEY DPLYR FUNCTIONS (verbs):
  # filter() - pick observarions by their values
  # arrange() - reorder the rows
  # select() - pick variables by their names
  # mutate() - create new variable with function of existing variables
  # summarise() - collapse many values down to a single summary

## all five can be used in conjunction with group_by(), 
## which changes the scope of each function 
## from operating on the entire dataset
## to operating on it group-by-group

## all five verbs work similarly:
  # 1. first argument is data frame
  # 2. next arguments describe what to do with data frame; var names without quotes
  # 3. result is a new data frame

# 5.2 filter rows

filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)

(dec25 <- flights %>% filter(., month == 12, day == 25))

# 5.2.1 comparision

# using '==' to compare floating point numbers is not intuitive

1 == 1/23533 * 23533
1/21 * 21 == 1 # in the book such examples results false ;)
1/49 * 49 == 1 # this is false

sqrt(2)^2 == 2 # and this is false

pi == sqrt(pi ^ 2) # true
pi == sqrt(pi)^2 # false

## to avoid confussion, we may use near()

near(pi, sqrt(pi)^2)

# 5.2.2 logical operators

(X <- LETTERS[1:5])
(Y <- LETTERS[4:8])

ltr <- cbind.data.frame(X, Y)
View(ltr)

filter(ltr, X == 'A', Y == 'D') # default is AND...
filter(ltr, X == 'A' & Y == 'D') # ...so same result as above
filter(ltr, X == 'A' | Y == 'D') # in this case OR gives same as AND

filter(ltr, X == 'A', Y == 'A')

filter(ltr, X == 'A' & Y != 'A')

filter(ltr, X == 'D' | Y == 'D')
filter(ltr, X == 'D', Y == 'D')

filter(ltr, xor(X == 'A', Y == 'D'))
  # make it simplier
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE & TRUE
FALSE & FALSE

TRUE | FALSE
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE

xor(TRUE, FALSE)
xor(TRUE, TRUE)
xor(FALSE, TRUE)
xor(FALSE, FALSE)

TRUE & !FALSE
TRUE & !TRUE
FALSE & !FALSE
FALSE & !TRUE

TRUE | !FALSE
TRUE | !TRUE
FALSE | !FALSE
!TRUE | !TRUE

xor(TRUE, !FALSE)
xor(TRUE, !TRUE)
xor(FALSE, !TRUE)
xor(FALSE, !FALSE)


## find all flights in november and december

(nov_dec <- flights %>% filter(month == 11 | month == 12))
summary(as.factor(nov_dec$month))


(nov_dec2 <- flights %>% filter(month %in% 11:12)) # 'x %in% y, z' is shorter form of 'x == y | x == z'
summary(as.factor(nov_dec2$month))

  # De Morgan's law:
    # !(x & y) == !x | !y
    # !(x | y) == !x & !y
!(TRUE & TRUE) == !TRUE | !TRUE
!(FALSE & TRUE) == !FALSE | !TRUE

!(FALSE | FALSE) == !FALSE & !FALSE
!(TRUE | FALSE) == !TRUE & !FALSE

## so filters below gives same results:

filter(flights, dep_delay <= 120, arr_delay <= 120)
filter(flights, !(dep_delay > 120 | arr_delay > 120))

# 5.2.3 missing values

NA > 5
NA == 1
NA *8 

NA == NA # confusing, but makes sense:
  ## when we don't know how big is A and how big is B, we still don't know if A equals B.

is.na(NA) # proper NA check

## filter() only includes rows where condition is TRUE; excludes both FALSE and NA's...
## ...but we can perserve NA's

df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1) # no NA's

filter(df, x > 1 | is.na(x)) # include NA's

### 5.2.4 excercises

# 1.

    # Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
flights %>% filter(arr_delay >= 120)

    # Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
flights %>% filter(dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))

    # Were operated by United, American, or Delta
nycflights13::airlines # check codes

flights %>% filter(carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))

    # Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
flights %>% filter(month %in% c(7:9))

    # Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
flights %>% filter(arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)

    # Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
flights %>% filter(dep_delay >= 60, arr_delay < 30)
    # Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
flights %>% filter(between(dep_time, 1, 600))

# 3.
apply(flights, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) %>% # count NA's for each variable
  sort(., decreasing = TRUE)                      # sort result in desc order

# 4.

FALSE & NA # A AND B resuls TRUE only when two sides are TRUE; so FALSE here

NA^0

    # some say'ideterminate form' http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.to.0.power.html

  # x^n = 1 * x1 * x2 * .. * xn
  # x^0 = 1 

NA * 0 # result is NA

# 5.3 Arrange rows with arrange()

## arrange changes order of rows; we can provide more than one column to order by

arrange(flights, year, month, day, dep_time)

arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay)) # descending order

arrange(flights, desc(day), desc(dep_delay))

## missings are always sorted at the end

tmp <- data.frame(v1 = c(1, 4, NA, NA), v2 = c(3, 5, 4, NA), v3 = c(NA, 3, 4, 4))
tmp
arrange(tmp, v2)
arrange(tmp, v1)
arrange(tmp, desc(v2))
arrange(tmp, desc(v2), desc(v3))


# exercises:
#

# How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).
# 
flights %>% filter(is.na(arr_delay)==TRUE) %>% arrange(arr_delay) # just filter works the same :) wrong idea

flights %>% arrange(desc(is.na(arr_delay)), arr_delay)

as.data.frame(flights[7:9]) %>% 
  arrange(desc(is.na(arr_delay)), arr_delay) %>% 
  write.table("flights_NA_first_1.csv") # first rows for is.na == 1, then is.na == 0, and for 0 ascending order

as.data.frame(flights[7:9]) %>% 
  arrange(desc(is.na(arr_delay))) %>% 
  write.table("flights_NA_first_2.csv") # like above, but no order for is.na == 0


# Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.
# 
  # most delayed:
flights %>% arrange(desc(arr_delay))

  ## how many hours late are 3 most delayed?

(minutes <- flights %>% arrange(desc(arr_delay)) %>% as.data.frame() %>% .[1:3, 9])

# Sort flights to find the fastest flights.

flights %>% arrange(desc(air_time)) %>% .[1:5, 12:15] # longest air_time
flights %>% arrange(air_time) %>% .[1:5, 12:15] # shortest air_time

# 5.4 Select columns with select()

select(flights, year, month, day) # select by names
select(flights, year:dep_time) # all variables form year to dep_time (inclusive)
select(flights, -(year:dep_time)) # all except those form year to dep_time (inclusive)

## there are number of helper functions to be used with select:
flights %>% select(starts_with("ye")) # matches names that begin with "ye"
flights %>% select(ends_with("time")) # matches names that end with "time"
flights %>% select(contains("delay")) # matches names that contain "delay"
flights %>% select(matches("(.)\\1")) # selects variables that match a regular expresion

num_names <- data.frame(x_1 = seq(1, 2, length.out = 5),
                        x_2 = seq(10, 69, length.out = 5),
                        x_3 = seq(0.1, 90, length.out = 5),
                        x_4 = seq(8, 9, length.out = 5),
                        y_1 = seq(2, 34, length.out = 5),
                        y_2 = seq(1, 1.2, length.out = 5))
num_names %>% select(num_range("x_", 1:3))
num_names %>% select(num_range("y_", c(1,2))) # matches variables with given prefix and numbers

## for renaming we use rename(), which is a kind of select()
flights %>% rename(destination = dest, carrier_abr = carrier) # syntax: new_name = old_name

## for reorder it's easy to use select() with everything()
flights %>% select(time_hour,air_time, # those two goes to first and second position
                everything())
## excercises 5.4.1.
# 1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights

flights %>% select(contains("p_t"), contains("p_d"), contains("r_t"), contains("r_d"))
flights %>% select(contains("time"), contains("delay"))
flights %>% select(matches("^dep_"), matches("^arr_"))                   
flights %>% select(dep_time:arr_delay, -contains("sched"))

# 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

flights %>% select(air_time, time_hour, air_time)
    # selects doubled names only once

# 3.What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?

var <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

flights %>% select(one_of(var)) # selects names from a given vector

# 4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?
  
  select(flights, contains("TIME")) # seems to be not case sensitive!
  
flights %>% select(contains("TIME", ignore.case = FALSE)) # here we check flag F to make case sensitive

# 5.5. mutate() - add new variables

          hours = air_time / 60,
          gain_per_hour = gain / hours
          )
  # transmute drops 'old' variables

# 5.5.1 useful creation functions

## function we use to create new variable with mutate,
## must be vectorised function:
## it must take a vector of values as input
## and return an output vector with the same length

# frequently useful functions:
  # arithmetic operators

    # %/% - integer division
    # %% - remainder
      # example to compute hour and minute form dep_time
