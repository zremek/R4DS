# scripts are "real", not the environment
# with scripts and data files, the env can be recreated easily!

# ctrl + shift + F10: restart RStudio
# ctrl + shift + S: rerun the current script

getwd()

# setwd() is not recomended

# in paths use "/" (forward slash)

# never use absolute paths in an R script

### input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures. 
### This is such a wise and common practice that RStudio
